# NBAStatClash
NBAStatClash is a website dedicated to comparing the stats of two NBA players from the 2022-2023 regular season. The primary aim is to assist fantasy basketball enthusiasts in drafting players for the upcoming 2023-2024 season. To cater to different fantasy leagues, there are two separate webpagesâ€”one focused on points leagues and the other on category leagues. The main reason I created this website was to work on my web development skills and to learn Django.

#### Categories Page
Here is how the website looks for comparing players in category leagues. First, both players' overall stats for the 2022-2023 regular season are shown. Then, the two players' stats are compared across each of the nine main categories. The winner of each category is shown in parenthesis after each stat.

#### Points Page
Here is the webpage for comparing players in points leagues. Because there are tons of different ways to weight each category, the user can adjust the weights according to their specific league settings.

This page also shows the overall stats for both players, however, the final comparison is how many fantasy points they scored on average per game played.
